PHP Enums Library
=================

Copyright (c) 2011 Tim Kurvers <http://www.moonsphere.net>

This library provides enum functionality similar to the implementation  
found in Java. It differs from existing libraries by offering one-shot  
enum constructors through static initialization, enum iteration as well  
as equality support and value, ordinal and binary lookups.  

**Required PHP version: 5.3**


Getting Started
---------------

The examples found in the library attempt to visualize a real-world  
situation. Additionally, they are independent and can each be used as  
a starting point for your own project.

* **API**: Introduction to the PHP Enums Library
* **Binary**: Combining enums using masks & flags
* **Constructors**: Enhancing enums by attaching data and behaviour 
* **Iteration**: Working with a list of defined enums
* **Sets**: Creating and using unique collections of enums
