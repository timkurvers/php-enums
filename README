PHP Enums Library
Copyright (c) 2011 Tim Kurvers <http://www.moonsphere.net>

This library provides enum functionality similar to the implementation
found in Java. It differs from existing libraries by offering one-shot
enum constructors through static initialization, enum iteration as well
as equality support and value, ordinal and binary lookups.

Required PHP version: 5.3
